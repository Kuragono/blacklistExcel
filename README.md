# blacklistExcel

This program was written at my job as a student for internal purposes. The goal was to deliver a tool for people that are not familiar with programming to be able to get the right js selectors with the right data inside without having to write everything by hand. This tool reduces the likelihood of mistakes and saves a lot of time. 

The way this tool works:
- You select a csv data, containing the months (January to December must be included) on the first row and the keywords that have to be blacklisted on the following rows.
- The tool will then show the data on the screen, so one has the ability to double check if the right data was chosen.
- One can choose between buttons depending on which adslot needs to change the js selector
- After clicking the button, one will automatically be led to the website of the adslot that needs to be changed, while the right js selector was copied to the clipboard and is ready to be pasted in the right section.
